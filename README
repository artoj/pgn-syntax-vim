ABOUT

    Portable Game Notation or PGN is a standard way to record chess games.
    The 'pgn.vim' file provides syntax coloring for PGN files in Vim.

    The syntax file is based on Charles Ford's work:

        http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=677

    I rewrote most of the syntax parsing making it more strict and adding new
    features such as support for comments and special characters in string
    values.

INSTALLATION

    Put the 'pgn.vim' file to your $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/ directory. Then you can
    use:

        :set syntax=pgn

    To use the syntax in the current buffer.
    
    To set the syntax automatically for certain file types, such as '.pgn' in
    this case, create a 'pgn.vim' in $VIMRUNTIME/ftdetect/ directory and add:

        au BufRead,BufNewFile *.pgn set filetype=pgn

    See ':help ftdetect' for more information.
